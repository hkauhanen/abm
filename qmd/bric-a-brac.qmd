A compendium of sundry miscellanea.

- [plot_birds_fixed.jl](jl/plot_birds_fixed.jl) -- A Julia Plots recipe, used to plot birds in the homework [Making birds fly](homework/fly.qmd)
- [VariationalLearning.jl](jl/VariationalLearning.jl) -- A Julia module that defines the `VariationalLearner` type and some functions to deal with such learners. See, in particular, [this homework solution](homework/modules.qmd). To use this, execute the following (don't forget the dot before the module name, as this is a local module):

  ```{julia}
  #|eval: false
  include("VariationalLearning.jl")
  using .VariationalLearning
  ```

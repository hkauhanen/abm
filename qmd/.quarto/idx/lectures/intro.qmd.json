This means a total of 100 x 100 = 10,000 parameter combinations.\n  - Suppose you want to replicate the simulation for each parameter combination 100 times for statistical reasons.\n  - Then you're looking at a total of 1 million runs.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n. . . \n:::\n\n- With 1 minute / run, we're looking at **2 years** to get the results!\n\n\n## How to deal with issues of speed\n\n1. Choose a suitable programming language\n1. Write **performant** code\n1. Whenever possible, **parallelize** your code\n    - This means running it simultaneously across many CPUs/computers; we will see later how it's done\n\n\n## Why is randomness needed?\n\n- Quite simple: real-world processes are complex, and to model such complex processes we resort to **stochastic processes**\n- A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables\n- For example, consider a \"navigating\" agent that turns into a random direction whenever it doesn't know how to proceed otherwise. In this case, the random direction needs to be generated using a **random number**.\n- Or consider a linguistic example: suppose Mary is friends with Bob, Fiona and Charles. Unless we want to claim that Mary's interactions with the other people are **deterministic** (which does not seem particularly sensible), we need some way of selecting interlocutors at random.\n\n\n## Why is randomness an issue?\n\n- Conventional computers are deterministic devices\n- So, if we need, say, a random number between 0 and 1, how is that accomplished?\n- The answer is a **pseudorandom number generator** (PRNG)\n  - This is an algorithm that generates a (long, but not infinite!) sequence of numbers which has the *appearance* of being random\n  - The sequence is generated from a **seed** number. If you give the PRNG the same seed, you will get the same \"random\" sequence of numbers (this takes care of the reproducibility requirement).\n  - **However**, there are significant issues...\n\n\n## Issues with PRNGs\n\n- Suppose your PRNG generates a sequence of 1M numbers...\n- ...but in your simulation you need to generate 10M random numbers^[We'll see later that this is by no means a crazy requirement!]\n- Then your \"random\" numbers will repeat 10 times\n- This means that different parts of your simulation are **not** independent of each other -- a major problem!\n- Further issues can arise when we look at parallel processing... but more on that later!\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- ABM is a powerful framework for modelling real-world processes\n- Models are complete, consistent and unambiguous\n- Individual agents exhibit bounded rationality\n- Challenges involve, among other things, simulation speed and proper implementation of randomness\n\n\n## The scientific community\n\n- ABMs are created and explored by people in all manners of disciplines from physics and chemistry to linguistics and economics\n- Examples of professional organisation in social sciences and linguistics:\n  - [European Social Simulation Association](http://www.essa.eu.org/)\n  - [The Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation](https://www.jasss.org)\n  - [The International Society for Computational Social Science](https://iscss.org/) (+IC2S2 conference)\n  - [Language Dynamics and Change](https://brill.com/view/journals/ldc/ldc-overview.xml?language=en) (journal)\n\n\n## Homework\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\nNext week, we will start programming.
